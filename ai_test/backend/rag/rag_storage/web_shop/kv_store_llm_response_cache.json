Please find only the missing entities and relationships from previous text.\n\n---Remember Steps---\n\n1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, use same language as input text. If English, capitalized the name\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event,category]\n- entity_description: Provide a comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities *based solely on the information present in the input text*. **Do not infer or hallucinate information not explicitly stated.** If the text provides insufficient information to create a comprehensive description, state \"Description not available in text.\"\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n- relationship_keywords: one or more high-level key words that summarize the overarching nature of the relationship, focusing on concepts or themes rather than specific details\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_keywords><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Identify high-level key words that summarize the main concepts, themes, or topics of the entire text. These should capture the overarching ideas present in the document.\nFormat the content-level key words as (\"content_keywords\"<|><high_level_keywords>)\n\n4. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n5. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n---Output---\n\nAdd new entities and relations below using the same format, and do not include entities and relations that have been previously extracted. :",
